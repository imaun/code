## Sum of two numbers

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the two indices of nums whose elements sum to target. Each input has exactly one solution and an element may only be used once. The answer must be returned in ascending order.

### Example :
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], target = 3
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 3, we return [0, 1].
```
